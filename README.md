Exploring GitHub, one example at a time!

Hi Humans, 
I am trying to learn how to program computers to automate some task, do some webscrapping and some data analysis with R and, probably Phyton. Along the way, I will need to pick up some other skills and programming languages as SQL, Java, JavaScript and html. 

I hope, I will be able to overcome the challenges and become a real expert. 

Cheers!
